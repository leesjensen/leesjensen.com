      <h1>LMS 3.0</h1>
      <p>
        The first learning management system (LMS) focused purely on management of grades and enrollments. The next wave
        worked to provide course content and student interaction. The next wave will successfully provide the following.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Content</b> that leverages the online experience. This will include instruction video with interactive
          paths, textual instruction, and self paced learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Human Interaction</b> between learning peers and mentors from around the globe in curated cohorts. Peers

          <b>Mastery Projects</b> that demonstrate authentic learning in creative ways that provide a portfolio of the

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>System Integration</b> that provides mastery reports, enrollments, analytics, and automated notification
