    <h1>A New Dawn of Learning</h1>
    <p>Enabling individuals to maximize their potential and contributions is a key component of global prosperity and peace. Outdated educational models where formative years are devoted to obtaining a standard set of knowledge with the goal of entering lifelong employment fall short in a globally connected world where technologies, skills, and opportunities rapidly fluctuate. We need a system that allows for the rapid learning of desired skills in anticipation of, and in response to, the immediate needs of markets and individuals.</p>
    <p>This necessitates three key players:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Educators that provide high quality, targeted, on-demand learning.</li>
        <li>Self motivated learners who see the immediate advantage of their efforts.</li>
        <li>Employers who advertise for, and hire learners, with specific skills.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>These key players all participate in:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Learning that is equally available to everyone.</li>
      <li>Learning that is accelerated by:
        <ol>
          <li>High quality prepackaged instruction presented by engaging actors</li>
          <li>Peer interactions</li>
          <li>Proactive mentors</li>
          <li>Mastery projects</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Learning that is self directed:
        <ol>
          <li>According to interest or need</li>
          <li>According to desired pace</li>
          <li>Anywhere, at any time</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Certification that is awarded after mastery is publicly demonstrated to peers and mentors.</li>
      <li>Immediate application to commercial success or individual satisfaction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Learning is primarily done through engaging online pre-recorded interactive video, but is augmented with individual and group mastery projects that occur physically. Peer interactions provide critical support and feedback that promotes understanding, social reinforcement, and encourages higher standards of performance. Learning is supported by a cadre of learning mentors that work directly with individual learners, to provide guidance, encouragement, and certification.</p>
    <p>The ability for the learner to self direct their learning and see the obvious application of their efforts through real world mastery based projects and employment opportunities is key to prolonged engagement and results.</p>
    <p>For the cost of one Hollywood movie we could initiate this vision by providing an online learning system that has all of the core learning concepts necessary to replace the entire core curriculum of the United States 7-12th grades, typical university department, or trade school.</p>
    <p>The system is sustainable because it is supported by content authors and mentors who are compensated directly by learners, or their sponsors, as well as employers paying recruitment fees for qualified applicants.
